### Config File

All property is optional and its can be combined with command line flags.

```ts
{
    /**
     * Repository owner name
     */
    owner?: string;
    /**
     * Repository name
     */
    repo?: string;
    /**
     * allow list that match branch names
     * Match all branches without excludesBranchPatterns's default by default
     * It means that matches branches without ["master", "develop", "dev", "gh-pages"]
     *
     * You can use RegExp-like string for this list
     * https://github.com/textlint/regexp-string-matcher#regexp-like-string
     * Default: ["/^.*$/"]
     */
    includesBranchPatterns?: string[];
    /**
     * Deny list that match branch names
     * You can use RegExp-like string for this list
     * https://github.com/textlint/regexp-string-matcher#regexp-like-string
     * Default: ["master", "develop", "dev", "gh-pages"]
     */
    excludesBranchPatterns?: string[];
    /**
     * You can set deletable stalled days after the branch is last pushed
     * Delete branches that are stalled 30 days by default
     * if today >= lastPushedDate + 30, its deletable
     * Default: 30
     */
    stalledDays?: number;
    /**
     * Default: 'https://api.github.com'
     */
    baseUrl?: string;
    /**
     * GitHub Token
     */
    token?: string;
    /**
     * If `dryRun` is `true`, does not delete actually
     * Dry-run mode fetch and dump
     * Default: false
     */
    dryRun?: boolean;
}
```

For example, `delete-github-branches.json` is following config.

`delete-github-branches.json`:

```json
{
    "includesBranchPatterns":  ["/^.*$/"],
    "excludesBranchPatterns": ["master", "develop", "dev", "gh-pages", "/^feature\/.*$/"]
}
```

And you can pass other options as command line flags 

```shell script
$ GITHUB_TOKEN=$GH_TOKEN delete-github-branches --owner azu --repo delete-github-branches-test --config ./delete-github-branches.json
```

## Usage: Library

```ts
(async () => {
    const results = await deleteGitHubBranches({
        owner: "azu",
        repo: "delete-github-branches-test",
        excludesBranchPatterns: ["master", "develop", "/feature/.*/"],
        token: process.env.token!,
        dryRun: true // <= dry run mode
    });
    assert.deepStrictEqual(results, [
        { branchName: "develop", deleted: false, reason: "It is ignored by includes/excludes patterns" },
        { branchName: "feature/a", deleted: false, reason: "It is ignored by includes/excludes patterns" },
        { branchName: "feature/b", deleted: false, reason: "It is ignored by includes/excludes patterns" },
        { branchName: "master", deleted: false, reason: "It is ignored by includes/excludes patterns" },
        { branchName: "will-be-deleted", deleted: true }
    ]);
})()
```

          RET=$?
          if [ "$RET" = "1" ]; then
