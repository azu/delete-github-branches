    owner?: string;
    /**
     * Repository name
     */
    repo?: string;
    /**
     * allow list that match branch names
     * Match all branches without excludesBranchPatterns's default by default
     * It means that matches branches without ["master", "develop", "dev", "gh-pages"]
     *
     * You can use RegExp-like string for this list
     * https://github.com/textlint/regexp-string-matcher#regexp-like-string
     * Default: ["/^.*$/"]
     */
    includesBranchPatterns?: string[];
    /**
     * Deny list that match branch names
     * You can use RegExp-like string for this list
     * https://github.com/textlint/regexp-string-matcher#regexp-like-string
     * Default: ["master", "develop", "dev", "gh-pages"]
     */
    excludesBranchPatterns?: string[];
    /**

     * if today >= lastPushedDate + 30, its deletable
     * Default: 30
     */
    stalledDays?: number;
    /**

}
```

```shell script
$ GITHUB_TOKEN=$GH_TOKEN delete-github-branches --owner azu --repo delete-github-branches-test --config ./delete-github-branches.json
```

        excludesBranchPatterns: ["master", "develop", "/feature/.*/"],
        token: process.env.token!,
        dryRun: true // <= dry run mode

    assert.deepStrictEqual(results, [
        { branchName: "develop", deleted: false, reason: "It is ignored by includes/excludes patterns" },
        { branchName: "feature/a", deleted: false, reason: "It is ignored by includes/excludes patterns" },
